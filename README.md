# Face Under Mask Reconstruction, Image Inpainting, and Object Detection and Segmentation with the Detectron2 library

 Steps:
 •	Preprocessed, cleaned, and prepared custom datasets for the model with over 21,000 images from the CelebA dataset

 •	Trained a detector from the Detectron2 library to detect and segment the occlusions in a face image

 •	Built vanilla and partial convolution encoders and decoders with a discriminator for the inpainting tasks

 •	Trained the inpainting module separately for several hours

 •	Achieved average accuracy in the results
