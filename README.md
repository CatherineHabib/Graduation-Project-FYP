# Face Under Mask Reconstruction, Image Inpainting, and Object Detection with Detectron2
____
##Steps:
•	Preprocessed, cleaned, and prepared custom datasets for the model over 21,000 images from the CelebA dataset
•	Trained a detector from the Detectron2 library to detect and segment the occlusions in a face image
•	Built vanilla and partial convolution encoders and decoders with a discriminator for the inpainting tasks
•	Trained the inpainting module separately for several hours
•	Achieved average accuracy in the results
