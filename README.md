# Face Under Mask Reconstruction, Image Inpainting, and Object Detection and Segmentation with the Detectron2 library

 Steps:
 
 •	Preprocessed, cleaned, and prepared custom datasets for the model with over 21,000 images🖼️ from the CelebA dataset

 •	Trained a detector🕵🏻‍♀️ from the Detectron2 library to detect and segment the occlusions in a face image of different ages👧🏻👩🏻👵🏻

 •	Built vanilla and partial convolution encoders and decoders with a discriminator for the inpainting tasks

 •	Trained the inpainting module separately for several hours⏳

 •	Achieved average accuracy🧾🏆 in the results📊
